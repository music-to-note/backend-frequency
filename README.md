# backend-frequency

Some scripts to determine the frequency of sample data

If you face issues, `brew install portaudio` before `pip install pyaudio`

Also you need to `pip install matplotlib`

Add configurations by writing `echo "backend: TkAgg" >>  ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` to run the matplotlib TkAgg backend
